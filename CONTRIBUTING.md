## Contributing.

Hey there, thank you for taking interest in this project. I'd list the steps you can follow to get started in contributing.

- First, you have to fork this repository. When you do that you're creating a copy of this repository under your own github account.
- Clone the repository (your own forked version), by doing this...

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/year-in-review.git
```

- Set the remote upstream of your forked repository to the base respository (i.e. the original repository)

```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Caleb335/year-in-review.git
```

- Create a branch and start working your feature. Say for example, the article you want to add was written by **Hannah**, you can go ahead to create a branch called **Hannah** and make your changes in that branch.

```bash
    git checkout -b Hannah
```

- Before you commit or make any changes, make sure you pull from the main repository which you have set as the upstream repository, so you can always have the latest version of the project. This is to avoid any issue of merge conflict in the future, for the maintainers of this project.

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

- Save and commit your change

```bash
    git add --all

    git commit -m "add hannah's article"
```

- Push to your branch, create a pull request and wait for it to be merged.

```bash
    git push origin Hannah
```

## Adding articles

The only file you'd be working with in this project is the `articles.js` file in the utils folder. `src/utils/articles.js`

In `src/utils/articles.js` we have an array of objects called `articles`. So all you have to do now is to add your own object in the format below.

The `title` key should accept a string value that holds the title of the article.

The `previewText` key should accept a string that shows probably an introduction from the article. You can decide to make this an excerpt from the article. But, it shouldn't be greater than two sentences.

The `author` key should accept the name of the author.

The `readMore` key represents the link to where the article was originally published.

The `date` key takes in the date that you added the article to this project. Say for example, you added an here today, the syntax below illustrates how to do that.

```javascript
date: new Date('Dec 1 2021, 13:41:00')
```

The `entry_id` key is for us to be able to keep tabs on the amount of items we have in the array.

```javascript
  {
    title,
    previewText,
    author,
    readMore,
    date,
    entry_id,
  }
```

Since we've already wrapped up with 2022, you'll be adding articles into the `twentyTwo` array. But, if you find articles that have been published previously feel free to add them in the `twenty` OR `twentyOne`array (which is short for 2020 or 2021).

## Happy Hacking!
